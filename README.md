Project Overview:

"I developed this project to analyze sales data during the Diwali season, helping businesses gain insights into customer behavior and optimize their strategies for future festivals."



Technologies Used:

"The project leverages Python for data analysis, Pandas for data manipulation, Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization, and Jupyter Notebooks for a clear presentation of findings."



My Contributions:

"I gathered and cleaned the sales data, performed exploratory data analysis (EDA), and created visualizations to uncover patterns and trends."



Challenges Faced:

"Handling the influx of data during the festive season was challenging, but it provided an excellent opportunity to optimize data processing pipelines."



Key Features:

"Comprehensive sales data from various regions."

"Time-series analysis to identify peak sales hours."

"Customer segmentation for targeted marketing strategies."



Results and Impact:

"The analysis revealed a 20% increase in sales compared to the previous year, with the majority of purchases occurring during evening hours. Businesses can now tailor promotions and inventory management based on these insights."
